```


This is a small script to launch Xcode using a RAM disk to store intermediate build products files, normally found in `DerivedData`.

## Motivation

After some time using Xcode, the DerivedData folder tends to grow. In my secondary development machine takes now 1.8 GB. Creating all these files in a RAM Disk destroys everything after switching off your machine (or ejecting the drive). Also, if you have enough memory, it speeds up compiling (everything happens in RAM)

This problem is shown here:

Also, in [this StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18933321/deleting-contents-from-xcode-derived-data-folder) discussion

## Installation

1. Just copy this script somewhere in your PATH, for instance to `/usr/local/bin` (using for example `cp xc-launch.sh /usr/local/bin`)
2. Grant it executable permissions: `chmod a+x xc-launch.sh`

To make use of it, you __need__ to change your Xcode preferences 

1. Go to Xcode > Preferences > Locations
2. Point Derived Data to /Volumes/ramdisk

You don't need to be root to run this :-)

When you finish, eject your ramdisk using the Finder.

## Works in

- macOS 10.9 - 10.12 - OK
- Xcode 6, 7, 8

Others: let me know, should work

## Will this thing make compilation faster?

I haven't timed it. Maybe using `time` and `xcodebuild` from command line with the same project, on average would be a good way to measure it. 

But I use this script mainly __because everything gets created in memory__:

- less stress put on my SSD
- no GB lost somewhere else in my HD

## How do you launch this?

Personally I use the terrific [DTerm](http://decimus.net/dterm), with a shortcut of Cmd + Alt + Ctrl + T (for Terminal), then use autocomplete to launch `xc-launch.sh`
